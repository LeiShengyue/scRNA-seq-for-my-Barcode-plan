# scRNA-seq for My Barcode Plan
Record of Code Used for Analyzing scRNA-seq data of Barcoded Aneuploidy Cells

My research centers on tracking the progression of Chromosomal Instability (CIN)-induced cells from a normal state to malignancy, utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and cell barcoding.
